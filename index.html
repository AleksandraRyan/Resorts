            This is one of the top properties on Galveston Island and is just

            columns. The beautiful beach in front of the hotel stretches on for

          <p>
            The resort's swimming pool is stellar, with vine-covered columns

            and has more outdoor Jacuzzis. There is also a popular restaurant
